    &quot Every child, regardless of their abilities, deserves more than just the bare minimum. They deserve a life filled with proper healthcare, nourishment, education,
   and opportunities to thrive. But for children with disabilities, the challenges they face are even greater, and the costs of meeting their needs can be overwhelming.
<br>
Imagine the struggle of a child with a disability, born into a family already burdened by poverty. These families, often abandoned by their husbands, are left to bear
 the weight of their circumstances alone. Single mothers, fighting against all odds, are forced to stretch every penny just to put food on the table.
<br>
In the midst of this immense hardship, there is a glimmer of hope: Malaika Initiative For People With Disability. This organization is a lifeline for these vulnerable 
children, providing them with the care and support they so desperately need. Malaika Initiative focuses on those who come from the most impoverished and destitute backgrounds, where every day is a struggle for survival.
